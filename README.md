Privacy policy

General

SMS Messenger is developed by one main developer, with a few people helping from time to time, mostly with translations.

Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how information obtained from users is collected, used and disclosed.

By using SMS Messenger, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy.

The app has no internet access, so it is not sending anything outside the device whatsoever.

Information being collected

SMS Messenger does not collect any personal identifiable information.

The READ_CONTACTS permission is used at getting contact names from phone numbers, also at showing contact suggestions. It is optional, the app works without it too.

The READ_PHONE_STATE permission is needed in cases the user has multiple SIM cards inserted, so he is able to toggle between them.

The app can access the users' phone number and it is broadcast to the telecom provider at sending a message, but we ourselves are not collecting or storing it in any way.

Changes to the Policy

If the Policy changes, the modification date below will be updated. The Policy may change from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically.
